            Saw is an American horror media franchise created by Australian filmmakers James Wan and Leigh Whannell, consisting of ten feature films and additional media. Nine of the ten films primarily revolve around the fictional serial killer John "Jigsaw" Kramer, while one film revolves around a copycat killer. John Kramer was introduced briefly in Saw and developed in more detail in Saw II and the subsequent films. Rather than killing his victims outright, he traps them in life-threatening situations that he calls "tests" or "games" to test their will to survive through physical or psychological torture, believing that if they survive, they will be "rehabilitated." John was killed off in Saw III, but the films continued to focus on his posthumous influence, particularly by his apprentices, and explore his character via flashbacks.<br />

Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton).
